##  Design Choices

### Tech Stack
- **Vue.js** for building interactive UIs with components.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive styling.
- **Dark Mode Support** for accessibility and user preference.

### Layout Strategy
- **Sidebar Navigation** with routes for Dashboard, Analytics, Products, Inventory, and Settings.
- **Header** with time-range selector, user menu, and theme toggle.
- **Component-Based Structure** for reusability (cards, tables, charts, etc.).

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Layout Padding Issues**
- **Issue**: Gaps between sidebar and header due to `pl-*` or `ml-*` classes.
- **Fix**: Applied `pl-0`, `ml-0`, and `w-full` where necessary to eliminate spacing.

### 2. **Dark Mode Consistency**
- **Issue**: Some elements didn't adapt to theme.
- **Fix**: Standardized use of `bg-white dark:bg-slate-800` and `text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200`.

### 3. **Responsive Tables**
- **Issue**: Product and inventory tables broke on small screens.
- **Fix**: Used `overflow-x-auto` and `min-w-full` with Tailwind for scrollable tables.
